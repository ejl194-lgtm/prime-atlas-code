Lina A. Shehadeh, PhD, is a Research Professor of Medicine at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.  
Her work bridges complex systems, gene regulatory networks, and translational cardiovascular biology, with a focus on
osteopontin, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and cardiometabolic disease. Trained in complex systems and
brain sciences and certified in data science and machine learning from MIT, Dr. Shehadeh integrates computational and
experimental approaches to uncover mechanisms of cardiac remodeling and mitochondrial dysfunction. She leads a
multidisciplinary research program, mentors trainees across career stages, and collaborates widely to bring innovative
therapeutic strategies closer to patients.
